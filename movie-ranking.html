        <h3>Funny Farm</h3>
        <img src="../images/funny farm.png" alt="funny farm" alt="funny farm" width=200> </br>
        Now, here is an oldie but goodie. Starring Chevy Chase back in the 80's, a man moves from
        the big city to a small country town by the name of RedBud. From a belligerent mailman, to finding a corpse 
        buried in their garden, Andy and his wife, Elisabeth had no idea what they were signing up for when they
        decided to put roots down in this wayward town. This is Chevy at his finest, so if you haven't seen 
        Funny Farm and you like to laugh, it is an absolute must.
